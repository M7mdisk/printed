This is a project idea I had and I used it while learning django, I'm  happy with the result and I learned a lot in the precess!

## Tech Stack
- Django Front-end (Templates) and Back-end
- Django geo-locate libraries
- OpenStreetMap and Leaflet js for Maps, since google Maps API is not free anymore..
- A lot of time :)

#### Feel free to use this in whatever you want
